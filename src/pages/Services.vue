            I will suggest changes/adjustments to improve your document and make your work as error free as
            possible. Your document will contain ‘track changes’ and ‘comments’
            in the margin if I have not understood your intending meaning. You will need to go through and Accept
            or Reject all the changes to finalise your copy. Students may wish to send their work through by
            chapters or as one whole document. 
        </p>

        <h3>ONE</h3>
        <p>
            Email me with your requirements, a word count, number of pages, referencing system (APA) and timeframe
            / deadline. Also, a date and preferred time of day. All communication is by email unless otherwise arranged.
        </p>

        <h3>TWO</h3>
        <p>
            We agree on a deadline, a quote / estimate and any particular requirements you may have. I will always do
            my best to meet your deadlines. I may add a fee for work requested at short notice or over a weekend. 
        </p>

        <h3>THREE</h3>
        <p>
            I will perform an initial read on screen and make adjustments. Then a second read through to capture
            anything I may have missed. 
        </p>

            ‘Track Changes’.
        </p>
            
        <h2>Your requirements</h2>

        <p>
            Please provide as many details as you can about your project for your estimate. If you have a deadline
            approaching, please specify this at your initial consultation and I will do my best to meet your
            requirements. If your requirements change please advise me as soon as possible in case the quote needs
            to be renegotiated. I am always happy to discuss the implications of any possible changes before you
            commit to them.
        </p>
