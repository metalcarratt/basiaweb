            <ul>

                <li>Formatting &ndash; Table of Contents &ndash; Word Choice</li>

            <p>
                I will suggest changes/adjustments to improve your document and make your work as error free as
                possible. Your document will contain ‘track changes’ and ‘comments’
                in the margin if I have not understood your intending meaning. You will need to go through and Accept
                or Reject all the changes to finalise your copy. Students may wish to send their work through by
                chapters or as one whole document.

            <p class="step one">
                Email me with your requirements, a word count, number of pages, referencing system (APA) and timeframe
                / deadline. Also, a date and preferred time of day.<br/><br/>
                All communication is by email unless otherwise arranged.

            <p class="step two">
                We agree on a deadline, a quote / estimate and any particular requirements you may have. I will always do
                my best to meet your deadlines. I may add a fee for work requested at short notice or over a weekend. 
            </p>

            
            <p class="step three">
                I will perform an initial read on screen and make adjustments. Then a second read through to capture
                anything I may have missed.

                Every project / client has different requirements, so do remember to include any particular specifications

            <p>

            <h2>Your requirements</h2>
            <p>
                Please provide as many details as you can about your project for your estimate. If you have a deadline
                approaching, please specify this at your initial consultation and I will do my best to meet your
                requirements. If your requirements change please advise me as soon as possible in case the quote needs
                to be renegotiated. I am always happy to discuss the implications of any possible changes before you
                commit to them.
            </p>
