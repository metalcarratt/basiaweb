She proofread my research project report (mini thesis) and several of my major assignments. Given that\r\n                English is my second language, Basia’s proofreading service has helped me to present my ideas clearly and concisely thus helped\r\n                me to submit well-written academic assignments. This truly contributed to my final grades which I am proud of. She is very\r\n                attentive to detail as she spotted everything which needed reviewing, from grammar to formatting. Basia simply corrects grammatical\r\n                errors in your scripts and never changes your original ideas. I found her very efficient, reliable and easy to communicate with. I\r\n                therefore strongly recommend Basia without hesitation to anyone looking for a professional proofreading service.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <label>Saamu Tui / National Project Assistant Officer at Environment Department</label>\r\n        </span>\r\n            \r\n        <span class=\"quote\">\r\n            <p>\r\n                My name is Mayerni Mutiara Situmorang. I took a Master of Science in Pharmacology at the University of Auckland. During my study\r\n                at the University of Auckland, I used Basia’s professional service to proofread my thesis. As an international student and English\r\n                is not my first language, I needed more time to understand, think and write my thesis in English. Basia gave fast and efficient service.\r\n                She did not object to proofread my thesis in a very limited time. Her work significantly improved the quality and readability of my\r\n                thesis. She engaged with the content and offered suggestions for more context-specific words which was very helpful and added to my \r\n                overall result. I would highly recommend Basia for her professional, fast, and efficient service.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <label>Mayerni Situmorang / March 2019 / Drug evaluator at National Agency for Drug and Food Control Republic of Indonesia</label>\r\n        </span>\r\n\r\n        <span class=\"quote\">\r\n            <p>\r\n                I am from Indonesia, and I have just graduated from the University of Auckland, in Applied Linguistics study. English is not my first\r\n                language therefore I was struggling with writing essays for my assignments. I used a grammar online checker, but it wasn’t really accurate.\r\n                My grade was affected by my writing skills. Then I decided to contact Basia for her proofreading service. She was very quick to respond,\r\n                and she did the proofreading extremely quickly. She not only checked my grammar and spelling, but also corrected formatting, style, and\r\n                diction. It was really helpful for my essays and dissertation writing. I got an ‘A’ for my dissertation, and I knew that was also because\r\n                of her help.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <label>Eka Citra Wardani</label>\r\n        </span>\r\n       \r\n        <span class=\"quote\">\r\n            <p>\r\n                Basia helped me proofread my essays during my Postgrad studies at the University of Auckland.

Mrs Garratt has a good reputation among my mentors and peers\r\n                who recommended me to contact her for my first essay in June 2020. She offers not only an affordable price but also a quick turnaround service.\r\n                For a master’s student to get an ‘A’ grade, writing research papers without any grammatical errors and typos is of great importance.
