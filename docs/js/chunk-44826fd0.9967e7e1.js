Very professional since the very beginning, Basia always sent back my corrections a few days after receiving my email. She pointed out everything that needed reviewing, from grammar to formatting, proving the necessary final view we students need while writing our thesis. Along the process of proofreading my work, I got pretty confident with Basia’s recommendations, which also reflected in my final grades. </p><label>Fernando Antunes Lopes April 2018 University of Auckland / Federal Inspector (Auditor Fiscal Federal Agropecuario) - Brazil</label></span><span class="quote"><p> I was a student at the University of Auckland (pursuing Master of Disaster Management) in 2019 when I started to use Basia’s proofreading service. She proofread my research project report (mini thesis) and several of my major assignments. Given that English is my second language, Basia’s proofreading service has helped me to present my ideas clearly and concisely thus helped me to submit well-written academic assignments. This truly contributed to my final grades which I am proud of. She is very attentive to detail as she spotted everything which needed reviewing, from grammar to formatting. Basia simply corrects grammatical errors in your scripts and never changes your original ideas. I found her very efficient, reliable and easy to communicate with. I therefore strongly recommend Basia without hesitation to anyone looking for a professional proofreading service. </p><label>Saamu Tui / National Project Assistant Officer at Environment Department</label></span><span class="quote"><p> My name is Mayerni Mutiara Situmorang. I took a Master of Science in Pharmacology at the University of Auckland. During my study at the University of Auckland, I used Basia’s professional service to proofread my thesis. As an international student and English is not my first language, I needed more time to understand, think and write my thesis in English. Basia gave fast and efficient service. She did not object to proofread my thesis in a very limited time. Her work significantly improved the quality and readability of my thesis. She engaged with the content and offered suggestions for more context-specific words which was very helpful and added to my overall result. I would highly recommend Basia for her professional, fast, and efficient service. </p><label>Mayerni Situmorang / March 2019 / Drug evaluator at National Agency for Drug and Food Control Republic of Indonesia</label></span><span class="quote"><p> I am from Indonesia, and I have just graduated from the University of Auckland, in Applied Linguistics study. English is not my first language therefore I was struggling with writing essays for my assignments. I used a grammar online checker, but it wasn’t really accurate. My grade was affected by my writing skills. Then I decided to contact Basia for her proofreading service. She was very quick to respond, and she did the proofreading extremely quickly. She not only checked my grammar and spelling, but also corrected formatting, style, and diction. It was really helpful for my essays and dissertation writing. I got an ‘A’ for my dissertation, and I knew that was also because of her help. </p><label>Eka Citra Wardani</label></span><span class="quote"><p> Basia helped me proofread my essays during my Postgrad studies at the University of Auckland. She was very professional and we had a good working relationship. The thing I like most about her is that she gave me a clear idea on the timelines. She managed to complete her work way before the deadline, giving me enough time to review it before the submission date. </p><label>Gay Marie Francisco / New Zealand Asean Scholar from the Philippines, Master of Public Policy / University of Auckland (2014-2015)</label></span><span class="quote"><p> I am originally from Myanmar and now pursuing a Master of Public Policy at the University of Auckland. As English is not my mother tongue, I always seek help from Mrs Garratt whenever I need to have my essays proofread. Mrs Garratt has a good reputation among my mentors and peers who recommended me to contact her for my first essay in June 2020. She offers not only an affordable price but also a quick turnaround service. For a master’s student to get an ‘A’ grade, writing research papers without any grammatical errors and typos is of great importance. Mrs Garratt has helped me reach that goal through her excellent proofreading service until now. </p><label>Cho Zin Oo</label></span><h2>PhDs</h2><span class="quote"><p> I submitted my PhD thesis document on the 29th of June 2020. The name of my thesis was &#39;Promoting oral health for people with cardiovascular disease: A mixed-methods study to inform the development of a nurse-led Cardiovascular Oral Health (CARDIOH) program.&#39; <br><br> I would like to let you know of my immense gratitude for your work editing and formatting my document. Your fast and efficient work made the hard time of the thesis submission period a lot easier. I was very surprised of your turnaround time, only a few days, not to mention cost effectiveness of your work. Your always prompt and friendly response to all my communication was very comforting. <br><br> My supervisors were also impressed with your work and have asked me to pass your name and contact to other students they are supervising. In fact, there have been two recent students that asked me for your contact, one from the School of Nursing and Midwifery of WSU and another from La Trobe University who was referred to my main PhD supervisor. </p><label>Paula Sanchez /Lecturer/ Engagement Coordinator Liverpool &amp; Campbelltown Campuses<br> School of Nursing and Midwifery / Western Sydney University</label></span><span class="quote"><p> I recently used Basia as an editor and proof-reader for my PhD thesis titled “Transfers to residential aged care: health professionals’ decision-making in hospital”. I had several conversations with Basia via email before sending my thesis and she was very helpful and happy to answer all my questions. I sent my thesis to Basia on 16th August 2020 and received it back on 21st August 2020. I am very happy with the result and thank her for the quality of her proofreading and her professional conduct throughout our interactions. </p><label>Tiffany Northall / Lecturer / School of Nursing and Midwifery / Western Sydney University</label></span><h2>Business</h2><span class="quote"><p> Basia is not only a great and goal-oriented proofreader and webpage editor but also an inspiring perfectionist.
