She proofread my research project report (mini thesis) and several of my major assignments. Given that\n                    English is my second language, Basia’s proofreading service has helped me to present my ideas clearly and concisely thus helped\n                    me to submit well-written academic assignments. This truly contributed to my final grades which I am proud of. She is very\n                    attentive to detail as she spotted everything which needed reviewing, from grammar to formatting. Basia simply corrects grammatical\n                    errors in your scripts and never changes your original ideas. I found her very efficient, reliable and easy to communicate with.
