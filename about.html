            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                My name is Basia Garratt and you pronounce my first name like ‘Russia’ but with a
                ‘B’ not an ‘R’. Both of my parents were born in Poland but I was born in Wellington,
                New Zealand. My husband and I have travelled and lived in Warsaw, Poland for four
                years and London for three years, but now reside in Hamilton, New Zealand.
            </p>
            <p>
                In 2009 I received a Diploma in Proofreading, Editing and Publishing from the New
                Zealand Institute of Business Studies and in 2012 a Certificate in English Language
                Teaching (TESOL) in London. On returning to New Zealand in 2013 I began
                proofreading for students with English as a second language from the University of
                
                Auckland, with many coming from Indonesia, Cambodia, Vietnam, the Philippines
                and Pacific Islands.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from taking on work from students I am also interested in proofing children’s
                short stories, cookbooks, reports and journal articles, etc. I am an avid cook and
                baker/ sampler of delicious café wares. I have proofread a variety of subjects from
                general assignments to Master’s degrees and PhD theses: Applied Practices,
                Biology, Chemical Engineering, Development Studies, Economics, Environmental
                Science, Evolutionary Psychology, Food Science, Foreign Policy, Geothermal
                Energy, Geology, Public Health, Public Policy, etc.
